# tuts
These are my C++ tutorials for begginers 
tut1 is a simple hello world example
tut2 is a variant of hello world using user input
tut3 is a calculator I wrote to demonstrate variable types

Every folder has a tut.sh just type ./tut.sh to begin tutorial 
Reminder: you have to cd into one of the tut folders before using ./tut.sh 

If you don't know how to compile C++ on linux use g++ <filename.cpp> -o <outputfilename>
You'll need g++ installed for that command to work.
Erase the compiled program before compiling the source code or you'll just overwrite the original file.
Also I suggest using vim or nano to view the source code or text files included in the folders.
All tutorials include the compiled program and source code for that program.

PlEASE do not take credit for my source code you are free to modify it for learning purposes but don't claim it as yours.
As long as you follow that rule I'm ok with you using or modifying my source code. I believe knowledge should be free for anyone willing to learn.

Lastly IF you want to contribute you can but please contact me first and follow these simple rules:
1. Source code must have good code comments
2. you must either write a tut.sh or tut.txt file to explain your tutorial I like seeing both but having is needed.
3. Must include compiled program from your tutorial source code
