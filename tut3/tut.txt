		This is a Simple calculator to learn how to use some variables in C++ 
1. int stands for integer so only whole numbers can be used for this variable type
2. float for non-whole numbers I prefer using double to float but there could be specific reason to use float over double just can't think of any right now
3. double the upgrade to float
4. string variable for single words
5. char or character array variable stores a certain number of characters that has to be specified

Example: 
int hmm;
so now we have a integer named hmm that nas no value currently. we can add a value by doing this:
int hmm = 4;
Now hmm equals 4 simple. You can also have a user input a value by:
cin >> hmm;
 also this tutorial teaches you about if else statements and goto statements
if you have any question look at the code comments in C++ source code provided 
And Please Don't steal or take credit for my source code I know it's simple but I've spent my time to write it so 
if you want to edit it go ahead just don't take all the credit for my base code OK?
Thank you and enjoy the learning experience!!
